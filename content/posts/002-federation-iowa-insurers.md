Some employees at the Federation of Iowa Insurers reached out to me after they were looking for some changes to their website. I worked on security for the website with encryption, as well as a members-only section of the website which requires the user to enter a password to access that portion of the site.

**Built with:** Wordpress & SSL Certificates for traffic encryption
