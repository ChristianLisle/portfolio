    <h1>Hi, I'm Christian :)</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a junior at Iowa State University majoring in computer science and minoring in cybersecurity engineering. I’ve worked on all sorts of computer-related projects, from building myself a computer at fifteen years old to developing an engaging website for a local hair salon, Roxy Seven Salon.

      I am currently working as a software developer apprentice at Source Allies. I am highly grateful for the opportunity to work for and learn from such a fantastic company.
