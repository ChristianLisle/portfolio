I'm a software engineer and junior at Iowa State University studying computer science. I've worked on all sorts of computer-related projects, from building myself a computer at fifteen years old to developing an engaging website for a local hair salon, [Roxy Seven Salon](https://roxysevensalon.com).

I'm not one for writing an extensive bio; besides, I think a lot of my work speaks for itself. Have a look around my portfolio to get a good sense of my work.

If you have any questions while viewing my website or simply want to get in touch, please feel free to [reach out to me](/contact).
